# Notes on Running a Virtual Workshop

# Before

Consider stretching the workshop.  Long 
Do we want a full day or to try a few hours per day over a few days? (“By spacing out the learning over a longer period, there is a much greater chance that your attendees will have the opportunity to digest, review, reflect, and apply what they learn” see [point 9](https://www.learningrevolution.net/host-a-virtual-conference-tips-for-success/))


Messaging that covers 
* Have to address the social strangeness
* Video online is hard to stay focused
* We’re going to stretch it out
* Tradeoff: more dropoff within the week, but keeps ideas in mind

### Software and Technology

* Video
  * Do we record? Are the recordings available to all? Do they inhibit discussion?)
* Discussion 
  * Slack

  * https://www.kialo.com/tour
  * https://mural.co/
  * https://realtimeboard.com/ 


### Prepare Speakers

* Train: This is how to present & lead a discussion effectively via video
* Test: Ensure that everyone has tested their setup before the day of
* Don’t be on slack while you present - moderators will select and pull stuff for you
* Clarify time per session (minutes per X on agenda)


### Prepare Attendees
* Set  norms (including that everyone’s on video for the full event? Many comment that this helps focus). 
* Prepare: Software installed and working in the setup you’ll be using.
  * Do you have bandwidth for everyone working from home?
  * Do you have water or coffee handy?
* Side channel expectations - use discussion platform extensively?


# During 

### Norms and Expectations
* Be explicit that this a new experience for most of us
* Regularly repeat and reinforce norms
* [Conference Call bingo cards](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christophefoulon_thanks-elizabeth-wharton-this-is-perfect-activity-6643898638852505600-ESoT) 
* Icebreakers? (See [point 4](https://trust.guidestar.org/running-effective-virtual-meetings-tools-and-technique-for-engagement) 

### Have a tech support plan
* Where do participants go for help with tech failures?
* Who ensures that everyone but the speaker is muted?

### Virtual Hallway Con
* Make time for this
* Emphasize that people can up use of the discussion platform
* Ask that people spend time in the virtual hallway, assume goodwill and try to make it work
